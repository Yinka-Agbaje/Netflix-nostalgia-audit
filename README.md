**A data-driven exploration of 1990s cinema to inform modern content production strategies focusing on nostalgic media styles.**

## 🎯 Strategic Objectives
For production companies specializing in "Nostalgic" content, understanding the DNA of 1990s cinema is crucial. This project audits the Netflix library to decode the structural patterns of the 90s, specifically focusing on:
* **Runtime Benchmarking:** Identifying the standard "pacing" of movies from this era.
* **Action Genre Audit:** Analyzing the prevalence of "short-form" action content (<90 mins) to understand historical audience attention spans.
* **Content Portfolio Shifts:** Evaluating how the 1990s differ in duration and genre density compared to modern standards.

## 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
- **Data Engineering:** Python (Pandas) for multi-level filtering and iterative row-processing.
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib for frequency distribution analysis (Histograms).
- **Methodology:** Decade-specific subsetting, genre isolation, and iterative runtime counting.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/data`: `netflix_data.csv` (Global Netflix catalog).
- `/notebooks`: Exploratory analysis and visualization scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: Environment dependencies.

## 📈 Industry Insights & Executive Summary

### 1. The "Golden Runtime"
The analysis identified that the distribution of movie durations in the 1990s peaks at approximately **100 minutes**. 
* For modern throwback productions, a 90-110 minute runtime is statistically the most authentic 90s feel for audiences.

### 2. The Action Movie Pulse
By auditing 1990s Action movies, it was discovered that **7 movies** fell into the "short-form" category (under 90 minutes). 
* Action cinema in the 90s leaned heavily toward longer, epic runtimes; short-form action was an outlier, not the norm.

## 🏛️ Strategic Recommendations

* **Production Pacing:** Target a **100-minute runtime** for nostalgic-themed scripts to align with historical audience expectations.
* **Genre Strategy:** Prioritize longer developmental arcs for Action titles, as the data shows the decade was dominated by full-length features rather than "short-burst" action content.
* **Market Positioning:** Use these duration benchmarks to market modern "retro" films as authentic 90s-style experiences.
